= branchhours: Show today's branch opening hours, taken from Google Calendars

There are eight libraries at York University and we want to show
today's openings hours for all of them on our home page.  

I'd read Andrew Darby's article in Code4Lib Journal issue 2, "Using
Google Calendar to Manage Library Website Hours"
(http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/46), which gave me the idea for
using Google Calendar.  It's a great article, and includes code and
also lets you show who's on the reference desk, so have a look at it
first.  To suit local needs, I decided to write something slightly
different and do it in Ruby.

Because our calendars are public, you should be able to run this
program without any configuration.  It will show some output on STDERR
and create ten small HTML files with out opening hours.

== Google Calendar

The API for Google Calendar is here:

http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/docs/2.0/reference.html

This program doesn't do any writing to calendars, just reading, so
it's dead simple.

The XML feed of the Bronfman Business Library's calendar (in the
"full" projection, with all the details) is here:

http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/m7c4318hko4aum2kmucq0g7kts%40group.calendar.google.com/public/full

I set the calendar to be public.  If you make the calendar private
you'll have to use the private URL or authenticate, which is explained
in the docs.

Let's add some parameters to customize the calendar request:

      singleevents=true                    # expand recurring events
      ctz=America/Toronto                  # our time zone
      start-min=2009-06-22T00:00:00-04:00  # start date
      start-max=2009-07-02T00:00:00-04:00  # end date
      orderby=starttime			   # for readability
      sortorder=ascending                  # for readability

Pipe the output to xmllint so it's more readable:

curl "http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/m7c4318hko4aum2kmucq0g7kts%40group.calendar.google.com/public/full?singleevents=true&ctz=America/Toronto&start-min=2009-06-22T00:00:00-04:00&start-max=2009-07-02T00:00:00-04:00&orderby=starttime&sortorder=ascending" | xmllint --format -

The only stuff in the XML that I care about are these fields:

<entry>
  <title type="text">Bronfman 10 - 6</title>
  <gd:when startTime="2009-06-26T09:00:00.000-04:00" endTime="2009-06-26T17:00:00.000-04:00"/>
</entry>

If the branch is closed for the day, I make an all-day event called
"Closed."

<entry>
  <title type="text">Closed</title>
  <gd:when startTime="2009-07-01" endTime="2009-07-02"/>
</entry>
